        <h1>Parallax</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Parallax effect is a visual phenomenon where objects closer to the viewer appear to move faster than those farther away. This creates a sense of depth and immersion in a two-dimensional space. In web design, parallax scrolling is a popular technique where background images move at a slower rate than foreground images or content, providing an engaging and interactive user experience. This method leverages the illusion of motion and depth to captivate users and guide them through the website's narrative or content journey.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The use of parallax effect in web design has gained significant traction due to its ability to enhance visual storytelling. By layering multiple elements with varying speeds of movement, designers can create dynamic and visually appealing web pages that draw users in and keep them engaged. This effect can be subtle, with slight movements to add depth, or more pronounced, creating dramatic visual shifts as users scroll. Regardless of the intensity, the parallax effect helps break the monotony of traditional web layouts, making the browsing experience more enjoyable and memorable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, the parallax effect must be used judiciously to maintain usability and performance. Overuse or improper implementation can lead to issues such as slower load times and disorientation for users. It is essential to balance the aesthetic appeal with functionality, ensuring that the effect enhances rather than hinders the overall user experience. When done correctly, parallax scrolling can be a powerful tool in a designer's arsenal, adding a layer of sophistication and engagement to a website.</p>
